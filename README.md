Spring 2021

Solution to practical homeworks and projects of Machine learning graduate course CE-717

1. # EDA & Visualization: This is a practice of EDA and Visualization methods on [this](https://github.com/atoosachegini/Machine-Learning-CE717/blob/main/EDA%20%26%20Visualization/data.csv) dataset.

2. Linear and Polynomial Regression: [This](https://github.com/atoosachegini/Machine-Learning-CE717/tree/main/Linear%20and%20Polynomial%20Regression) is a practice of implementation Linear and Polynomial Regression from scratch in Python.

3. Logistic regression-decision tree-Adaboost: A practice of three machine-learning methods on [Blood Transfusion Service Center dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center
)
4. Loopy Belief: [This](https://github.com/atoosachegini/Machine-Learning-CE717/tree/main/Loopy%20Belief) is a implementation of Loopy belief propagation for LCPD.

5. Kmeans & GMM: [This](https://github.com/atoosachegini/Machine-Learning-CE717/tree/main/Kmeans%20%26%20GMM) is an implementation of K-means and EM for GMM from scratch.

6. Pneumonia Classification with Resnet: [Resnet implementation](https://github.com/atoosachegini/Machine-Learning-CE717/tree/main/Pneumonia%20Classification%20with%20Resnet) for Chest-Xray Pneumonia Dataset.

7. Projects:
  1) COVID19-data-classification-prediction: [A machine learning project](https://github.com/atoosachegini/Machine-Learning-CE717/tree/main/COVID19-data-classification-prediction) to anticipate if patients need ICU to plan better during COVID-19 epidemy. I tested different methods. My final method is Logistic Regression which is
  able to predict if a patient needs to be admitted to ICU only by using the data in his first hours of being in the hospital. With this method I have reached to F-Score 83%
  
  2) Sarcasm Detection: [This](https://github.com/atoosachegini/Machine-Learning-CE717/tree/main/Sarcasm_Detection) is a group project in which we have tested many methods include SVM, Adaboost, Naive-Bayes and Deep-Learning Networks
  in order to detect whether a text is sarcastic or not. Our [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/sarcasm) is Reddit comments.
